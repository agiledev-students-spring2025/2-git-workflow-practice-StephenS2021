# [My Article](https://abcnews.go.com/US/deepseek-coding-capability-transfer-users-data-directly-chinese/story?id=118465451)

I chose this article because I find U.S. news media seems to be incredibly concerned about Chinese tech companies stealing user data. I, maybe naively, do not really care or attempt to protect by personal data past using an ad blocker. It seems like a losing battle anyway. I think it's funny how the U.S. government demonizes China stealing your data while American companies are constantly harvesting any information they can from their users.
